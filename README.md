# Queer Calendar

The Queer calendar a 'complete' agenda with the queer events, for now only focused on Amsterdam.

## Roadmap

- MVP make something
- Make it multilingual
- Manual adding of events
- Add filters based on keyword and date?
- Option to register an account and add your own events
- Create some sort of scraper so we can add a url and make an event (with the meta data from the url). Could be cool if it would also work from an instagram url.
