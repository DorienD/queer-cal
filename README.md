**A community-driven, open source calendar for queer events in, for the moment, Amsterdam.**

Queer Calendar is a grassroots initiative to centralize LGBTQIA+ event listings in one inclusive, accessible and privacy friendly web calendar. Whether you're looking for the next party, a workshop, or an activist meetup — this project aims to make it easy to stay connected **without relying on Big Tech & Social media**.
